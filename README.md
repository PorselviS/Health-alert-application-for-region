Module 1: Gathering information and Designing [Vaishnavi Y] 
Module 2: Responsible design and Programming [Porselvi S] 
Module 3: Database Connectivity [Praveen kumar PS] 
Module 4: Executing the application [Teamwork]

ADVANTAGE : It is user friendly and easily accessible.Reduce paperwork.Fast Process.Patients medical records in digital format,hence the data is secured. 
DISADVANTAGE: Presently all the health alert functionalities are done manually.Lack of security of data.Consumes large volume of paper work.No direct role for the higher officials
CONCLUSION: The main aim of this app is to provide the essential information to the government to maintain hygienic environment. This helps everyone to live withoutaffecting from disease. The key idea we applied here is the automation. The automation we applied can save us from time, error, data missing, labor and much more. The simpler is now gone much simpler and the application can be managed by a few people. The process we done above is collected data from the user is verified by authority and passed to government. This will be very useful as the people cannot able to solve this problem by themselves.We would like to conclude that our project will surely bring some changes in our environment. Hence in future enhancement, will be individual person get medical alert.
PROBLEM STATEMENT

PROJECT ABSTRACT:
Health alert application is an android and Ios based application. This app is developed in “Ionic” platform. It mainly concerns about dengue and malaria. Using this app people can enter their  particulars directly. The data which has been entered by the people will be verified and reported to the authority. Authority will request the respective and the necessary steps will be taken.It is mainly useful for government to take survey and provide statistical report of a particular area regarding health conditions. 

PROBLEM DEFINITION:
In existing system this process has to be done manually by the people and then checked manually by the authority. This new system will automate those process by using Ionic software. Since it is of automated there will be less chance of errors and time consumption is reduced. As the data is maintained confidentially, the details will be more secure and no loss of data. 

TECHNOLOGIES:
Ionic
We used Ionic framework to build the Health alert app. It is build according to the specifications of the both Android and iPhone. Through the Android app, we will be projecting the Health alert app into the rural area. Most of the people use android mobile but in this modern world people migrating to Apple. Hence a good app should be able to run in both platform (Android & IOS).
Node.js
Node.js is a package in which we use express framework. An Application Programming Interface (API) level operation is done in this framework. This acts as an intermediate between the frontend and backend. Frontend is designed with JavaScript. According to the request the data will be fetched from the backend and displayed in frontend.  
Mongo DB
In this project, backend is designed using Mongo DB. It is a database used to store and retrieve the given data. It is similar to that of MySQL but there is some differences, namely:
•	MySQL stores the data as table whereas Mongo DB it is stored as key value pair
•	MySQL is structured data but Mongo DB is unstructured
